You can use the BoltRing with your self-sovereign Bitcoin Lightning node or a commercial service provider. </p> <p>Get your own BoltRing at https://bitcoin-ring.com.</p> <p>A Community Effort</p> <p>The capabilities of the BoltRing are the results of contributions from developers and enthusiasts all around the world - most notably the Bolt Card Project and  CoinCorner. Using this technology means being  part of a global community of people who believe in the power of permissionless, decentralized, peer-to-peer transactions.</p> <p>By adopting this technology, you are not only getting access to cutting-edge payments capabilities, but you also get the opportunity to shape and influence the development of the technology while supporting a movement that aims to democratize access to financial services and promote financial freedom.</p> <p>The State of Development</p> <p>Please note that the BoltRing is still in its early stages. It is currently only supported by a limited number merchants, wallets, and the setup of the BoltRing may still be technically challenging. However, we believe that the benefits of using contactless payment technology for Bitcoin are worth the effort, and we are here to support you every step of the way.</p> <p>About the Documentation</p> <p>Our documentation is designed to guide you through every step, making it as easy as possible. We encourage you to experiment with the BoltRing and not to be afraid to try new things. By working through the documentation, you'll be able to take advantage of the ring's capabilities and learn about the underlying technology and how it all works.</p> <p>The documentation will cover all the necessary steps to get started and to be able to make your first bitcoin payments with the BoltRing. We will review the software and hardware requirements, the setup process, and how to pair the ring with a lightning service and your mobile wallet. From there, you can make convenient and contactless bitcoin payments.</p> <p>Let\u00b4s go</p> <p>We hope you enjoy using your new BoltRing, and we look forward to your feedback and suggestions.
