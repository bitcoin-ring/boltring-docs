# Getting started with your BoltRing

To use your **BoltRing** you must pair it with a compatible Wallet and Bolt Card service. The
service is then responsible for verifying and processing the unique payment URLs generated by your 
BoltRing according to the configured payment rules.

As always, with Bitcoin, there are different options for setting up, operating, or using a Bolt Card
service for your BoltRing, with varying features and tradeoffs.

!!! danger "Backup your Keys"

    You need keys to re-configure your BoltRing. **Without keys you cannot reset or re-configure
    your device!**

    Keys are initialy set to ZERO at factory settings unless you bought a pre-configured BoltRing.
    For pre-configured BoltRings the keys are printed as QR code on the enclosed leaflet.
 
    After you re-configured your BoltRing **you will need the newly set keys** for any further 
    re-configuration (the original keys will not work any more).
