## What is the BoltRing?

The **BoltRing** is the first Bitcoin DIY contactless payment ring. It uses NFC technology and the
open-source **[Bolt Card](https://www.boltcard.org/)** system to bring the *tap-to-pay* experience
to Bitcoin Lightning. You can operate the BoltRing with your self-sovereign Bitcoin Lightning setup
or use it with a commercial service provider.
