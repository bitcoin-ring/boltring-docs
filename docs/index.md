## What is the BoltRing?

The **BoltRing** is the first Bitcoin DIY contactless payment ring. It makes use of NFC technology
and the open source **[Bolt Card](https://www.boltcard.org/)** system to bring the *tap to pay*
experience to Bitcoin Lightning. You can operate the BoltRing with your own self-soverign
Bitcoin Lightning setup, or you can use it with a commercial service provider.
